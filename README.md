# Introduction to DBMS
### Data
Data is referred to as the collection of raw facts or figures that can be processed to derive meaning or knowledge. It is a collection of information gathered by observations, measurements, research, or analysis. In simpler terms, data is any fact that can be stored, e.g., "EXY", "12", etc.
### Information
* Data when processed becomes Information. 
* Information is the knowledge obtained from investigating, studying, or instructing data. For example, "Raj" is just data that can be written in a register, but when assigned to a person, it becomes information, i.e., the name of that man.

<b>For Example:</b> Consider the string “orange”. Here, it could mean a color or a fruit. This term “orange” is data. However, if we say “color orange” or “fruit orange”, it becomes information.

## Database
A database is a structured collection of interrelated data organized in a way that enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. Key characteristics of databases include:
* It is a collection of interrelated data.
* It can be stored in the form of tables.
* It can be of any size.

<b>Example of database:</b>

For example, in a multimedia database, the image table would contain information about images like pixels, length, and width. Similarly, the video table would have features like pixels and video length. The image and video tables would be part of the multimedia database.

Similarly, a college database would have tables like professor and student tables that are related to the timetable for class schedules.

# Introduction to DBMS
### Data
Data is referred to as the collection of raw facts or figures that can be processed to derive meaning or knowledge. It is a collection of information gathered by observations, measurements, research, or analysis. In simpler terms, data is any fact that can be stored, e.g., "EXY", "12", etc.
### Information
* Data when processed becomes Information. 
* Information is the knowledge obtained from investigating, studying, or instructing data. For example, "Raj" is just data that can be written in a register, but when assigned to a person, it becomes information, i.e., the name of that man.

<b>For Example:</b> Consider the string “orange”. Here, it could mean a color or a fruit. This term “orange” is data. However, if we say “color orange” or “fruit orange”, it becomes information.
